(SINGING) Let it go!
Let it go!
Can't hold it back anymmore
Let it go!
Let it go!
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
OLAF:(GRUNTING) What's happening?
(GASPS) I'm alive!
Who said that?
I said that.
I can talk. I can think. I can juggle.
No, i cannot.
I got too confident there.
I appear to be some sort of snowman.
(CHUCKLING)
How absurb is that?
How is that even possible?
What am I even saying? Who am I?
Hello? Anybody there?
I'm having a bit of a crisis of identity, I think.
(CHUCKLING)
So, I'm made of snow
and I'm walking on snow.
Oh, that's kind of weird.
I think I'm lost and confused.
I'm definitely confused.
KRISTOFF:(SINGING)
Reindeers are better than people
OLAF:(CHUCKLING) Barn songs.
Hello? Anybody missing a snowman?
(CHUCKLES)
-(DOOR OPENS, BELL CHIMES)
-Yoo-hoo!
Welcome to Wandering Oaken's.
(GASPS) Ooh!
Wandering Oaken's?
Do you know that if you
scramble up those letters,
-it's an anagram for Naked Norwegians?
-Mmm?
-Oh!
-(OLAF CHUCKLING)
And I can't even read.
I genuinely don't know
how I just did that.
You know what? I like you.
What do you need?
(SIGHS) A sense of self.
I don't even know my name.
I kind of look like a Fernando...
or a Trevor.
And where's my nose?
-You want a nose?
-Yes. But I don't have any money.
That's okay.
That's very generous, fuzzy man bear.
Do you have any, uh, carrots?
Oh. I just sold my last ones.
(OLAF GROANS)
But I'm sure we can find you something
that will fit the bill.
Ooh! Ow!
Uh... Mmmm-mmm.
(SHRIEKS)
OLAF: What is this?
-That would be of summer.
-Summer?
It's beautiful!
Hey... Uh... Oh!
Bees buzzing!
This is sun! Butterflies!
Ooh! Blue skies!
(GIBBERING) Ah!
Oh!
(GASPS)
I've never identified with anything
so much in my whole life.
It's like snowmen and summer
just belong together.
Oh,I'm not so sure about that.
But if it's summer you like,
I've just the nose for you.
A sausage?
A summer sausage.
-Ya!
-ANNA: Ooh!
Thank you, big, loveable,
pink-faced bear man.
I'm off to find my name!
Ah, what a nose!
(SNIFFS)
Processed meat.
(wOLVES GROWLING)
-(SHRIEKING)
-(BARKING)
Stay away!
Since when do wolves eat meat? Ahhh!
(GRUNTING) I'm falling apart!
Is this a skill or a flaw? 
(SCREAMS)
Skill! Skill!
Flaw!
KRISTOFF: You got engaged to someone
you just met that day?
OLAF: Whoa!
Everybody, stay together.
Use the buddy system.
(WOLF GROWLS AND WHIMPERS)
Have you seen our butt?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No! No! No! 
Back together again at--
You have friends who are love experts?
I'm not buying it.
-Stop talking.
-No, no, no. No, no.
-I'd like to meet these...
-No, I mean it.
(WOLVES GROWLING)
(SCREAMINGS)
ANNA: Get ready to jump, Sven!
Yes! No!
Hmm?
(GASPING AND GIGGLING)
Maybe it's still...
(GROANS)
-(WOLF WHIMPERING)
-Hmm?
(BARKING)
Huh?
(WHIMPERING)
You need this even more than I do.
Here you go.
Aw! (SQUEALS)
(GASPS)
(LAUGHING)
That felt just like a warm hug.
(YOUNG ANNA AND YOUNG ELSA LAUGHING)
YOUNG ANNA: Do you wanna build a snowman?
Do the magic!
(GASPS)
I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.
ANNA:I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.
Skill!
